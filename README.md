# 🌧️ Rainfall Impact on Agricultural Productivity

Power BI Dashboard analyzing the relationship between monsoon rainfall and crop yields in India (1966-2017)

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

This project analyzes 50+ years of agricultural data to understand how rainfall patterns affect crop productivity across Indian states.

### Key Findings
- **Rice Yield**: ↑ 70% growth since 1960s (1,615 Kg/ha)
- **Wheat Yield**: ↑ 73% growth (1,626 Kg/ha)
- **Maize Yield**: ↑ 106% growth (1,507 Kg/ha)
- **Key Insight**: Technology and irrigation matter as much as rainfall - Punjab achieves 7x higher yield than Rajasthan despite lower rainfall

## 📁 Files Included

- `rainfall-agricultural-productivity.pbix` - Main Power BI Dashboard file
- `data/` - Source data files (if applicable)
- `screenshots/` - Dashboard preview images
